/*
arguments breakdown:
"pixel* screen"

Type: Pointer to an array of pixel objects.
 Purpose: Represents the 2D "screen" or image where the circle will be drawn. Each element in this array corresponds to a pixel in the image, stored in a 1D format (row-major order).
    Why a Pointer?: It allows the function to directly modify the pixel array (the "screen") passed to it, avoiding unnecessary copying of large data structures.


question: could we have also used "pixel& screen" instead of "pixel* screen" as an argument inside the "void drawCircle" function above?

ChatGPT:


No, you cannot use pixel& screen instead of pixel* screen for the drawCircle function in its current implementation. Here's why:
1. Nature of the Argument

    pixel* screen:
        This represents a pointer to a dynamically allocated or statically sized array of pixel objects (essentially, a memory block containing multiple pixel elements).
        The pointer allows you to manipulate individual pixels within this 1D array.
    pixel& screen:
        A reference to a single pixel object.
        It cannot represent an entire array of pixel objects.

If you attempt to pass an array to pixel& screen, the function would only reference a single pixel (likely the first element in the array).
2. Why pixel& screen Won't Work

The code accesses pixels in a 1D array using:

screen[y * width + x]

    This syntax calculates an index to access a specific element within the screen array.For this to work, screen must be an array or a pointer to the first element of an array.

If you replaced pixel* screen with pixel& screen, the compiler would throw an error because screen would no longer represent an array, and indexing ([]) would not be allowed.

3. When to Use pixel& screen

A pixel& reference could be used if youâ€™re working with a single pixel, not an array. For example, in a function to modify a single pixel:

void setPixelColor(pixel& screenPixel, const pixel& color) {
    screenPixel = color;
}

Here, the reference would allow direct modification of the specific pixel passed to the function without creating a copy.

**4. Alternative: std::vector

If you want to avoid pointers altogether and still handle a collection of pixel objects, you could use a std::vector:

void drawCircle(std::vector<pixel>& screen, int width, int height,
                int x_circle, int y_circle, unsigned int radius, pixel color) {
    for (int y = 0; y < height; ++y) {
        for (int x = 0; x < width; ++x) {
            int dx = x - x_circle;
            int dy = y - y_circle;
            if (dx * dx + dy * dy <= radius * radius) {
                screen[y * width + x] = color;
            }
        }
    }
}

Advantages of std::vector

    Safety: No need to manually manage memory.
    Readability: Avoids raw pointers, making the code easier to understand.
    Flexibility: Automatically handles resizing if needed (though not applicable for fixed-width screens).

To use this approach, you would initialize the screen like this:

std::vector<pixel> screen(width * height);


Conclusion

    You cannot use pixel& screen as it only represents a single pixel, not an array.
    The current implementation with pixel* screen works for arrays.
    Using std::vector<pixel> could be a modern and safer alternative to raw pointers.
